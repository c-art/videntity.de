Who has not read my thesis about "<a href="http://www.xml-clearinghouse.de/reports/Grenzen_und_Potentiale_semantischer_Aggregation_von_personenbezogenen_Internet-Daten.pdf">Semantische Aggregation personenbezogener Daten</a>" published by  <a href="http://www.xml-clearinghouse.de/">XML Clearinghouse</a> is now able to study a more professional, more precisly, but english drawn up article about "what do we get from virtual identities, if we do so in a much larger approach". Written by Hugo Liu, Pattie Maes, Glorianna Davenport (MIT) named <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~hugo/publications/drafts/IJSWIS2006-tastefabrics.pdf">Unraveling the Taste Fabric of Social Networks</a> reveals what is possible with myspace.com, ontologies and many other cutting-edge technologies. Even Plato, the old greek, comes into play.

So prepare yourself and your identity on myspace.com or only be amazed what is possible.
