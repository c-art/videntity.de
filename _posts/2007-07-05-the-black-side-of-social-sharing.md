Hey, check this out! I just found this random <a href="http://www.slifeshare.com/user/zer0one">sLife profile page</a>. The guy (or somelse) watched (well, not so) strange movies, <a href="http://www.slifelabs.com/slife/">sLife</a> tracked and shared them online. Now, everyone can see which flicks he watched - nice!. His excuse: *pay no attention to the hokey pokey videos there. It wasnt me... I swear!*

Well done! ;-)
