Today I was trying out <a href="http://30boxes.com">30boxes</a>, because <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/0,1518,488347-5,00.html">someone told me it is much better than Google Calendar</a>. I typed in my email, username to subscribe and wondered.

Suddenly it knew my <a href="http://twitter.com/skurt">twitter-acoount</a>, my <a href="http://flickr.com/people/skurt/">flickr-photos</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/seppkurt">myspace blog</a>. Furthermore it provides me with a picture of me, the one I have on twitter.

The good thing is, I do not have to retype all those informations... :-)
