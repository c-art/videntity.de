<p>I do have a problem: I like profiling and my privacy! Can they exists simultaneously?</p>
<p>I'm really into all the web2.0-profiling stuff: flickr, delicious, youtube, lastfm, plazes, twitter, myspace, facebook, blogs... It's amazing how easily you can publish and share your stuff. Collect your friends, discuss, meet new people, get feedback and new inspirations. Do you remember the good old days where self-hacked-static-html-websites was so only way to get online? What a mess - for god's sake - they're finally gone!</p>
<p>But every coin has two sides. As it is so down-to-earth to use people tend to share everything - without knowing what they are doing. Internet is a big, everlasting archive: once&nbsp;your&nbsp;data is in, it'll get never out - and google &amp; co. get it all. As of this, foreign people may have access to your data, which was only meant for your friends or personal storage. Years later, you data can be found - even it's already deleted on your page - google cache and archive.org do&nbsp;thier&nbsp;best! Who no-techie-users knows about that? I&nbsp;myself&nbsp;must confess, I don't know what personal data of mine is already out there, it's so hard to keep track.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As my tool <em>whoami</em>&nbsp;displays,&nbsp;its&nbsp;technical&nbsp;quite simple to aggregate your data, &nbsp;create relations, new coherences. Suddenly your are transparent for everyone!&nbsp;<br />
So, what is a good solution to strike a balance between sharing data and still having privacy? Is it just&nbsp;using those websites with brain &amp; care? Do we need more technical support, do we need more educational advertising?</p>
