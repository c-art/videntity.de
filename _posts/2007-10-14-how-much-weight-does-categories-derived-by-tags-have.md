<p>As a result of the questions "what category does this tag belong to?" on encyclopedias knowledge we obtain a list of categories. But in what extent does this count in the interestprofile? The Formula beneath trys to calculate some weight.<a href="http://www.videntity.de/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files/2007/10/gewichtkat_en.gif" title="weight of categories derived by tags"><img src="http://www.videntity.de/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files/2007/10/gewichtkat_en.gif" alt="weight of categories derived by tags" /></a></p>
<p>c stands for count, g for weight. the formula reads as follows: " The weight of a category arises by its invers count of appearance multiplied with the sum of all tags in all services weighted by the count of appearance of one tag in a service, the weight of the tag an the weight of the service".</p>
<p>Weigth of service measures if tags are rarely used in a serive (e.g. delicius vs. flickr).<br />
Weight of tag measures how important ist a tag, but this needs to be improved, it is not exactly clear how to detect important tags. Maybe you got any ideas?</p>
