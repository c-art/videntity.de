After a long time of silence but hard working, I am happy to announce the final presentation of my Diploma Thesis. Feel free to come and discuss with me on Friday, this week, 3 pm in room 2.16 at DFKI Kaiserslautern.


## Abstract:

 -- Mediated Identity - Semantic Data Mining through Social Media Web Services --
Due to recent Internet developments the user is no longer just an information consumer - she interacts with other people through the websites, publishes new content and shares her personal media online. This act of self-expression and presentation is part of her virtual identity and reveals much about her personality, interest and doings. What data have I published where? What does it tell about me? Who am I on the Internet? - are just some of many interesting questions to answer. But as the data is decentralized and stored in different independent systems, there are hardly interconnections. It is difficult for the user and other people to get a complete overview of the content and therefore to observe and further analyze her virtual identity. An approach to this problem is discussed in the thesis. The data mining web application 'WhoAmI' is developed to centralize the user's media followed by a data analysis and various visualizations. The presentation gives a deeper view into the thesis task and shows how the web application is implemented with the help of the Ruby on Rails framework using a modern, agile web development approach. An application demo follows afterwards.
