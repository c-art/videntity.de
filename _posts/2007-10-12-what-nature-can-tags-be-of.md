The approach to use only tags for interest determination brings some new questions.

Not only that even tags that won't get useable data from encyclopedias are maybe good to use in other context, e.g. all the [geo-information provided via tag](http://edcompblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/where-in-world-geotagging-and-flickr.html) can [be used to get data about users locations when providing data](http://www.roblog.com/flickrfly-docs).

But what nature can tags be?

 * numbers e.g. years
 * ratings
 * recommenddations for other users beginning with `for:` (delicious)
 * reminders like toRead, toDo (and similar noptations 2Read)
 * opinions e.g. fun, funny, humor
 * geography data starting with `geo:` or `ge:`
 * mechanical tags with prefixes like `filetype:`


Is this all? Are there more then this? Does anyone bring it into order? Maybe Metatagging, will do but do you know?
